# Sets

A set is a well defined **collection** of mathematical objects.  
It's considered an object itself too.

Sets can be represented symbolically: $\{\}$, and the objects go between the brackets.

If there was more than an object in a set, they are separated with the symbol $,$ (comma sign).

For example:
if we want to, we can create a set composed of the numbers $2$, $4$ and $6$.  
So, our set would be $\{2,4,6\}$
