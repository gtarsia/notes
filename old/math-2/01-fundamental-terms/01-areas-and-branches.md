# Areas, branches

*(This a subjective opinion on these terms rather than one based on consensus)*

A traditional divison of mathematics is into two groups:
* Pure mathematics (mathematics studied for its intrinsic interest)
* Applied mathematics (mathematics that can be applied to real world problems)

From these then come branches who sometimes have their own branches too.

For example:
* *number theory* is a branch of pure mathematics (and a major branch in mathematics in general)
* *arithmetic* is a branch of *number theory*

For a list of areas and branches, check [this list on said wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Areas_of_mathematics#Major_divisions_of_mathematics).
