# Symbols unambiguity

While some objects can be represented with either of a few symbols,  
(eg, $\times$ and $\cdot$ both represent the *multiplication operation*)

With very few exceptions, almost all mathematical symbols represent only one object.  
Because of this, most symbols are unambiguous and interpretations do not depend on contexts.

## Exceptions

There are some exceptions to symbols representing only one object.

The $(\ ,\ )$ symbol can represent one of these:

* function
* image
* precendence grouping
* tuple
* highest common factor
* open intervals

Which one it represents on a certain instance depends on the context of it.
