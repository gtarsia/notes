# Expression

A mathematical expression is a finite combination of mathematical symbols that is well-formed.

By well-formed, we mean that the rules of the objects the symbols represent

Mathematical symbols can designate numbers (constants), variables, operations, functions, brackets, punctuation, and grouping to help determine order of operations, and other aspects of logical syntax.
