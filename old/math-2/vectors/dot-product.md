# Dot product

The dot product is an **binary operation** between two vectors of same dimensions.

It's represented with the dot sign ($.$)
(which is used as well as one of the symbols for multiplication).

It results in a 1-dimensional value that is the sum of all multiplications between every element of both vectors that are in the same position.

For example, if we have two vectors:
