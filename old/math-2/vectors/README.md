# Vectors

*Requires [math-01/vectors](/math-1/vectors)*.

A vector is an ordered pair of two n-dimensional value.

For the simplicity of learning and to reduce calculations, the provided vectors
usually have the first value in the origin.

For example: the vector $((0, 0), (1, 2))$ is just described as the vector $(1,2)$.
