# Math 1

This is the bottom-most section for math.

This section tries to explain mathematical things in an intuitive way
so that a person in his teenage years could understand with just enough cognitive load.

It is not meant to be mathematical factual or accurate, but instead, a cognitive easing, a groundwork for understanding math 2.

It is not, however, equivalent to elementary math (such as, explaining counting).
