# Variables vs. constants

A **variable** is a symbol that can be assigned **different numbers**.

Oppositely, a **constant** is a symbol that **doesn't change** or is **fixed**.

Variables are usually represented with the letters $x$, $y$, $z$ and other greek letters,  
while constants are usually represented with with the letters $a$, $b$ and $c$.

For example, let's say we have the "generic" form of a polynomy:  
$\ ax^2+bx+c$

In a valid instance of a polynomy:
$a$, $b$ and $c$
