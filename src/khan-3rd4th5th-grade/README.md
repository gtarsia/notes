*Note: I think the challenge in this course is that 
this is the first time a kid learns about overlapping classifications.

When I first heard about quadrillaterals, squares, rectangles, it didn't immediately dawn on me that a quadrillateral could be a square as well. I thought they could only be one thing at a time.

I think it would be easier for them if they would use a cognitive easing with animals and specific species.

Like all jiraffes are animals, but not all animals are jiraffes. The same way all squares are quadrillaterals but not the other way around.*
