# Triangles by lengths of sides

## Equilateral triangle

An equilateral triangle is a triangle where all three of its sides have the same length.

## Isosceles triangle

An isosceles triangle is a triangle where two of its sides have the same length.

## Scalene triangle

An escalene triangle is a triangle where none of its sides have the same length.

## Interesting properties on equilateral triangles

Since all of the sides of an equilateral triangle have the same length, all of its angles also measure the same (you can check this by drawing).

Also, since the sum of all angles of a triangle equal $180°$, and all three angles are the same this means that

$angle + angle + angle=180°$  
$3*angle=180°$  
$angle=60°$

So each angle in an equilateral triangle measures $60°$.

This in turn means that all equilateral triangles are acute triangles (although some acute triangles are not equilateral triangles).
