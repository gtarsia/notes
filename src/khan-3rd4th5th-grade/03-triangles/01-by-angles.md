# Triangles by angles

These are classifications of triangles by their **inner** angles.
On this page we will refer to inner angles as just angles.

## Acute triangles

An acute triangle is a triangle where all of its angles measure less than $90°$.

## Right triangles

A right triangle is a triangle that has one $90°$ angle.

An angle that measures exactly $90°$ is also called a **right angle**,  
so, we say a right triangle has one right angle.

## Obtuse triangles

An obtuse triangle is a triangle where one angle is over $90°$.

## Trying to come up with a new triangle by-angle type

Try to invent and draw a triangle with two right angles.

As you try to join the lines together, you'll start to notice that
what you're drawing isn't a triangle, but some other polygon with more than 3 sides.

The same happens if you try to invent and draw a triangle with two angles over $90°$.
It just can't happen because it stops being a triangle,
the same way you can't invent build a window that has no hole.

This starts to show that there aren't other triangles types by angle that you can come up with.

Notice that all triangles have two angles below $90°$.
