Finding common denominator is a method used to be able to add or substract fractions with **different denominators**.

For example, $\frac{1}{2}$ and $\frac{4}{3}$, have different denominators ($2$ and $3$ respectively).

If we want to, let's say, add these fractions, like:

$\frac{1}{2}+\frac{4}{3}$,

we can't just add the numerator and denominator like:

$\frac{1+4}{2+3}$ (this does **NOT** equal to our previous expression).

Instead, we need to **transform each fraction** so that they both have the **same denominator**.

A fast way is to multiply each fraction by a fraction that has **same numerator and denominator as the opposite fraction's denominator**, for example:

$(\frac{3}{3})(\frac{1}{2})+(\frac{2}{2})(\frac{4}{3})$

The left side gets multiplied by $\frac{3}{3}$ because $3$ is the opposite fraction's denominator, and viceversa for the right side.

The result is this:

$\frac{3}{6}+\frac{8}{6}$

And now that we have $6$ as denominator in both fractions, we **only** add the numerators and combine the two denominators into one:

$\frac{3+8}{6}=\frac{11}{6}$
