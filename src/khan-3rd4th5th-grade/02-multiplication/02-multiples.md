# Multiples

A **multiple of a number $a$** is a number that can be "reached"
by multiplying with some other number.

For example:
$2*3=6$

$6$ is a multiple of $2$ and a multiple of $3$.

However, $7$ is not a multiple of $2$, because there's no number $2$ can be multiplied to where the product results in $7$:

$2*3$ equals $6$, one number shy of $7$,  
And $2*4$ equals $8$, one number above $7$.

So, we can't "reach" $7$ by multiplying $2$ with another number, therefore $7$ is **not a multiple of** $2$.
