# Factors

A **divisor** of a number (let's call it $a$) is a number that, when it divides $a$, leaves no remainder.

The factors of a number are **all the numbers that are divisors** of that number $a$.

For example, these are all the possible multiplications that result in 12:

* $1*12=12$
* $2*6=12$
* $3*4=12$

(You can try to find any other possible combinations, but good luck with that)

From this we say that the factors (aka all the divisors) of 12 are:

$1,12,2,6,3,4$

And in order:

$1,2,3,4,6,12$
