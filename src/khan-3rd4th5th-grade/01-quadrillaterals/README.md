# Quadrilaterals

A quadrilateral is a polygon with four sides.

There are also 3 special types of quadrilaterals.

## Rectangles

A rectangle is a quadrilateral that has four right angles.

## Rhombuses

A rhombus is a quadrillateral whose sides all have the same length.

## Square

A square is a quadrillateral that:

* Has four right angles
* Has all sides with same length

So it's a combination of a rhombus and a rectangle.

## Parallelogram

A parallelogram is a quadrillateral that has exactly two groups of parallel sides.

## Trapezoid

A trapezoid is a quadrillateral that has exactly one of parallel sides.
