# Server side channels

A channel is like a controller, but for websockets.

This is what the parent channel should be:  
*Note: this should already be generated by the rails app generator.*

```ruby
# app/channels/application_cable/channel.rb
module ApplicationCable
  class Channel < ActionCable::Channel::Base
  end
end
```

Then you would create your own channel classes.  
For example, you could have a ChatChannel and an AppearanceChannel:

```ruby
# app/channels/chat_channel.rb
class ChatChannel < ApplicationCable::Channel
end
 
# app/channels/appearance_channel.rb
class AppearanceChannel < ApplicationCable::Channel
end
```

These can be generated using `rails generate channel <channel_name>`.

## Subscriptions

The `subscribed` method is called when a consumer subscribed succesfully
to this channel.

```ruby
# app/channels/chat_channel.rb
class ChatChannel < ApplicationCable::Channel
  # Called when the consumer has successfully
  # become a subscriber to this channel.
  def subscribed
  end
end
```
