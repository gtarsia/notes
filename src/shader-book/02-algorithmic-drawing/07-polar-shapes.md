# Polar shapes

It revisits that radius can be calculated with `length` and
angle with `atan`.

We can draw shapes using polar coordinates.

This technique is a little bit restrictive but simple.
It consists of changing the radius depending on the angle.

And you can modulate using shaping functions.

Then it says, again, to use `min` and `max` for distance fields.
