# Sine and cosine

Sine fluctuates between $+1$ and $-1$.

This can be used to animate properties.

* We can add u_time causing the sine wave to move
* Multiply x by PI so that the sine wave is parallel to numbers
* Multiply x by u_time causing to compress more and more, to the point of being irrecognizable
