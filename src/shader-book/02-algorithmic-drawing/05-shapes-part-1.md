# Shapes Part 1

## Rectangle

`if` statements can be replaced with `step` calls.
The end results can be multiplied (since these are either 1 or 0).

The example also runs a step on a vec, instead of just a value.

## Circle

The function `distance` (which internally computes the length of the diff between two points)
can be used.

Then shows the same computation with either `distance`, `length` or `sqrt`
