# Square into triangle

I want to draw a square that transforms into a triangle.

I'm thinking of making the left and right lines skew.

Somehow I should be able to make both vertical to point to the upper center of the square.

I see that the abs function does something like this, but inverted, and I'm no sure it even works the same way.

I'm thinking of creating a square first.

Ok, I managed to create two lines.

Now I need to make the right side line to get smaller based on time.
So It's not quite the same.

I see that I could use step and sine(u_time) to cutoff the line. 

I hoped to repeat things by multiplying and then running the fract but apparently that isn't working, and I'm trying to figure where the fuck i saw that.

Ok, this thing is working, but the problem is that the triangles look like they are together.

I considermaking them a bit separate, but it turns out to be difficult.
It doesn't seem to be getting pretty, which is something that I expected, and I don't know if it's worth the effort to keep going down this road.

I worry that I lack the artistical creativity to create something.
