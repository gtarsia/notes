# Ratios

A ratio is how many of something containes another.

If I eat japanese food twice a week, then the ratio of eating japanese food per day is $2:7$.

## More does not change ratio

If I ate japanese food at the same rate over the course of 4 weeks, the ratio wouldn't change.  
It would still be $2:7$.

Thanks to the ratio we could find out how many days I had japanese food in $4$ weeks.
$2*4:7*4$, $8:28$.

In 4 weeks (which is 28 days), I ate japanese food 8 times.
